# 🔐 180 Days of DSA for Cybersecurity

Welcome to my **180-day journey** to master **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**, with a special focus on **Cybersecurity applications**. This repository will be updated **daily** with code, explanations, and real-world analogies that connect DSA concepts to InfoSec principles.

---

## 🚀 Why This Journey?

Understanding **how memory works**, **how data flows**, and **how to optimize logic** is fundamental for writing secure systems, analyzing vulnerabilities, and building tools in cybersecurity.

---

## 📌 What You’ll Find Here:

- ✅ Java code for each DSA concept
- 🛡️ Cybersecurity insights related to each topic
- 🔗 LeetCode problems with optimized solutions
- 📚 Real-world analogies for better understanding
- 💡 Time and space complexity analysis
- 🧠 Secure coding practices
